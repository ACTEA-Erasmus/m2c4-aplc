# The Watertank Project
_____________________________________
-   The [first goal](../Ex04/Subchapter03_1.md) is to program an ON/OFF controller
-   The [second goal](../Ex04/Subchapter04.md) is to program a PID controller
-   The [third goal](../Ex04/Subchapter05.md) is to deliver a working program

Back to the [project scope](../Ex04/Subchapter03.md)

## Scope

Automate controlling the level in **watertank T1**. that is equipped with
- An analog level sensor
- An analog flow sensor on the outlet
- An analog inlet valve
- An analog outlet valve

![Procedure element ON OFF](../Ex04/Images/scope.jpg)

Use the buttons, lamps, potentiometer and analog indicator on the ASTI PLC board to control the watertank.

## Characteristics
- Height: 3 m
- Diameter: 2 m
- Discharge pipe radius: 0.125 m
- Input flow: 0.25 m³/s
- Output flow: 0.3543 m³/s
