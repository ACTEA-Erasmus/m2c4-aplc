# The Watertank Project
_____________________________________
-   The [first goal](../Ex04/Subchapter03_1.md) is to program an ON/OFF controller
-   The [second goal](../Ex04/Subchapter04.md) is to program a PID controller
-   The [third goal](../Ex04/Subchapter05.md) is to deliver a working program

Back to the [project scope](../Ex04/Subchapter03.md)

## Goal 3: To deliver a working program
_____________________________________

**Step 1:** Compile the hardware with a rebuild all command

**Step 2:** Compile the software with a rebuild all command

**Step 3:** Download hardware and software to the PLC_1

**Step 4:** Test the Project

__Normal functionallity__
- The PID will slowly increase(or decrease) when setpoint changes and ultimately stop at the setpoint
