-   The [first goal](Ex04/Subchapter03_1.md) is to program an ON/OFF controller
-   The [second goal](Ex04/Subchapter04.md) is to program a PID controller
-   The [third goal](Ex04/Subchapter05.md) is to deliver a working program

Back to the [project scope](Ex04/Subchapter03.md)

## Goal 3: To deliver a working program
