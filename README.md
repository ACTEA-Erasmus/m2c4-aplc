# Problem Statement
STEM-education is very relevant for East-African countries, as producing added value is a way of improving life standard in these developing countries. Moreover there is a high demand for technicians from investors, NGOs and the emerging mid-class in Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania, supported by legislative attempts to increase local employment. To cope with this demand, there is a need for skilled people, trained in relevant engineering trades, but they are hard to find, due to the strong theoretical approach in universities instead of practice-oriented competence-based teaching. This is directly related to the lack of modern curricula in engineering and industry-grade equipment.

# Goal of the project
The ACTEA project aims to fulfil the specific needs in engineering, provide better skills matching, deliver course material in 2 specializations, Computer Aided Manufacturing Technology and Electrical Engineering & Automation and, establish technologic laboratories, with virtual and remote accessibility, establish learning tools, give academic staff additional training on technology and in developing technologic course material according to EU standards.

# Methodology
To ensure a good skills matching, the project includes research on both labour market demands and competences included in current curricula. For example, work package 1 includes the development, distribution and analysis of surveys for stakeholders (teachers / students / local labour market / output competences from secondary education). During the project, pre- and post measurements of all training activities are performed as well.

# Output
The results will be disseminated and exploited with train-the-trainer sessions, Master Classes and with training of a pilot group of internal and external stakeholders. Good practices and results will be made public through e-resources, radio and local media. The Business Integration Bureau favors cooperation with local business, for trainings, employing students or as client for end-products. All is done according to a well-defined quality assurance scheme.

# Impact
The impact on the short term is increased technological and pedagogic knowledge, increased operational capacity, increase in engineering students, and a better cooperation with local industry. On the long term, the project aims at an increase in employability, in added value produced locally, sustained life-long-learning and long-term high-quality knowledge gain in technology.
