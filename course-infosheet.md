## Prerequisites
* Participated in Basic PLC Programming

## Study materialsS
* Course
* Software – SIEMENS TIA Portal Professional

## Technical requirements / lab equipment
* Hardware – SIEMENS S7-1200 CPU on didactical panel
* Virtual automation enviroment – Realgames Factory IO

## Leaning outcomes
The theoretical part of the course starts with the advanced TIA Portal
instructions and solutions with the focus on analogue signal processing and datalogging.

It continuous with an introduction into industrial network devices on Profibus & ProfiNET with the focus on HMI, IO devices, drives and PLC-PLC communication.

It ends with the engineering of software where students learn to apply software analyses such as GRAFCET and FLOWCHART.

The course continuous with hands-on workshops where students apply their
knowledge to develop engineering skills. The student learns to select automation devices, to translate software analyses to software code, to troubleshoot PLC hardware and software problems in an enviroment that simulates the workfield.

At the end of this course a student is able to analyse a complex automation problem and to work out a solution.
